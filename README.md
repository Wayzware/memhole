# memhole
Linux kernel module to de-escalate memory security (give all users kernel-level memory permissions)

This was made as a tool for me to learn more about program memory and the kernel. 

I would not recommend installing on a real machine, as it bypasses many of the security features of Linux.

Requires:
    Kernel version 5.18 or higher (Ubuntu 22.04 currently runs 5.15)
    GCC
    Make
